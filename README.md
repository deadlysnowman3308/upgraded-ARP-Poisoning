## What is ARP-Poisoning?

- ARP Poisoning (also known as ARP Spoofing) is a type of cyber attack carried out over a Local Area Network (LAN) that involves sending malicious ARP packets to a default gateway on a LAN in order to change the pairings in its IP to MAC address table. ARP Protocol translates IP addresses into MAC addresses. Because the ARP protocol was designed purely for efficiency and not for security, ARP Poisoning attacks are extremely easy to carry out as long as the attacker has control of a machine within the target LAN or is directly connected to it.
